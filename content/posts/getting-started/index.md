Are you ready to create your own website, that you completely control? Before we
dive into the project, here are a few things to know about how *this* website
works.

The Rebel Web is your guide to creating an identity on the internet. If you
follow the articles one by one, you'll end up with a website of your own design
at a domain name of your choosing, for all to see.

Articles are organized in a sequence from start to finish, so it's strongly
recommended that you read them in the order shown, but feel free to skip an
article if it is familiar to you. Each article will present one bite-size piece
of the puzzle that combines to create your website.

We use footnotes[^1] to point you to deeper knowledge on a topic, definitions,
and other errata. It is never required to read footnotes to get your website up
and running! We include them to allow you to go deeper only if you wish to.
Click the footnote superscript to jump to its content, and then click the arrow
at the end to return to the reference point.

[^1]: Like this one

Some code, variables, markdown, and other values that you will be working with
are shown as "inline code," `like this`. When values appear like that, it
indicates that the value should be used exactly as shown, without any
surrounding quotation marks and so forth.

Creating websites involves writing code. Longer blocks of code will be shown in
a fancy, color-highlighted fashion to aid in legibility. The colors of code
shown on these pages may not be the same as what you see in your own editor.
That's OK!

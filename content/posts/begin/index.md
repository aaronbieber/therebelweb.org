The "Domain Name System" is just a way to give websites memorable names. Let's
dig deeper into how it works.

The name of a site that you see in your browser's address bar, like
`therebelweb.org`, is called a "domain name." A domain name is just a way to
make the location of a website memorable for humans. Computers don't really care
much about domain names, but we'll get into that later on.

A domain can only point to one website, and so they are a finite resource. For
that reason (among others), you need to pay some money to "register" a domain
name so that you can point it to your website. This also attempts to make people
behave themselves by recording who owns which domain.



To put a website online, you need the following things:

1. The website's files themselves, the "source code" and media like images and
   so forth that are displayed there.
   
2. A web server that "hosts" those files and serves them to visitors.

3. A domain name by which your site can be reached.

And that's it! Once you have those three things, you have your own website.

The Rebel Web is here to guide you through the process of assembling these three
things and putting your first website online. No matter where you are on your
journey, The Rebel Web is here to help.

## Where do you want to go next?

Choose one of these areas to start the next step in your learning journey:

* Learn more about how the web works

* Start creating your first webpage

* Register your own domain name

* Sign up for a web hosting service

A website, at its most basic, is just a text file. The text in that file is
mainly HTML[^1], which is a way of describing content to a web browser. The HTML
is what creates *structure* for your content, and also provides some *semantic
meaning*.

Web browsers are fully capable of displaying plain HTML, which you might think
of as "raw content." But that would be pretty boring, so we use CSS[^2] to tell
the browser what things should look like. Both HTML and CSS are *just text*.

### Domains

### Servers

Finally, once you've created all of these text files that web browsers can read,
and it all works exactly the way you want it to, you want to let other people
see it. That's where a server comes in.

The server's job is simply to send your carefully crafted HTML and CSS files to
anyone who asks for them. "Asking," in this case, is just visiting the domain
name that you registered.

### OK, OK, but what does this all mean?

The big take-away here is that you need just three things to put a page on the
web for all to see:

1. A page of HTML and optionally (but probably) CSS.
2. A server, somewhere, to "host" the file.
3. A domain name that gives your site a memorable, human-readable address on the
   Web.

With a little experience, all of this can be done in one day. Of course, what
kind of a site you want to design may dictate how long it takes to create, but
the basic building blocks are straightforward to pull together.

# The Rebel Web

This is the source code for the Hugo-generated statc site at https://therebelweb.org.

The mission of The Rebel Web is to help anyone, anywhere create their identity
on the web, and to retain their independence and control over the content and
ideas they create. The Rebel Web is about what we can make ourselves, with our
own hands, the way the web "used to be" (and, news flash, still is).

The Rebel Web is a work in progress, it's a movement, it's an ideal, it's a
community. You are part of The Rebel Web.
